# Hi y'all!

This blog covers my thoughts about health policy, health care delivery, & the culture around health in the US.

[Posts](https://bainbridge.github.io/health_share/posts) fall into two categories: **Issue** and **Personal**.

**Issue** posts address topics that I have wondered about or been asked about. I first write a breakdown of the issue, with links to evidence / whatever current wisdom I have dug up. I then write about the issue's importance & how we can become engaged around this issue.

**Personal** posts address topics that I have some personal experience with & want to write about -- maybe to get something off my chest, to ask for feedback from my peers, or to help me form an idea. I'll try to separate these posts into my own experience vs. broader implications and questions.

My goal with this project is to share what I have learned through my work & graduate studies. Health policy is confusing & overwhelming, even for experts. I am not an expert! I just want to share what I do know -- or think I know -- in the hopes that it might make these issues less confusing & overwhelming to my peers.
