FAQs &amp; thoughts re: health policy, care delivery, &amp; culture

Hi y'all!

I'm Sarah, a grad student living in Somerville, MA. I study public policy with a focus on health.

Who I am: Before grad school, I worked as a health care research analyst at an economic consulting firm in Boston. During that time, I learned about the incentives and barriers that impact disease management, outcomes, and health system costs. Before that, i studied economics and Arabic at a liberal arts college in Vermont. Though I love New England, I also miss Texas, where I grew up.

Why you should read this page: In my career, I want to examine health policy research & regulations with a critical eye, help people understand the impacts of health care research & policy, & help policymakers figure out what people want. I don't have any formal writing experience, so I'm here to work on that. I'd love your comments and questions -- they'll help me get better at this.

Where I'm coming from: I believe that universal health coverage, which 1) is financed by a single payer and 2) prioritizes preventative health care and focuses on the social determinants of health, is the most appropriate way to tackle the public health issues facing the United States. I am open to other ideas, though!

My perspectives on policy are heavily informed by my experiences with major depressive disorder, migraines, and a nebulous chronic pain disorder. I'll write about these experiences too!
