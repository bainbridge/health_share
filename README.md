# Hi y'all!



Who I am
-
I'm a grad student living in Somerville, MA. I study public policy with a focus on health. 

Before grad school, I worked as a health care research analyst at an economic consulting firm in Boston. During that time, I learned about the incentives and barriers that impact disease management, outcomes, & health system costs. 

Before that, I studied economics & Arabic at a liberal arts college in Vermont. Though I love New England, I also miss Texas, where I grew up.

Why you should read
-
In my career, I want to examine health policy research & regulations with a critical eye, help people understand the impacts of health care research & policy, & help policymakers figure out what people want. I don't have any formal writing experience, so I'm here to work on that. I'd love your comments & questions -- they'll help me get better at this.

Where I'm coming from
-
I believe that supporting universal health coverage -- which specifically 1) is financed by a single payer  & 2) prioritizes preventative health care & focuses on the social determinants of health -- is the most appropriate way to tackle the public health issues facing the United States. I am open to other ideas, though!

Why it's personal
-
My perspectives are heavily informed by my experiences with major depressive disorder, migraines, & a nebulous pain disorder. I'll write about these experiences too!
