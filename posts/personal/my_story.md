**CW: depression, anxiety, suicidality**

*Originally posted on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bainbrridge/status/1005166863637188614) following the deaths of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain**

As a little kid, I often felt anxious. Especially at bedtime. I'd cry and tell my parents I couldn't go to sleep because I hadn't 'done something' yet -- something was unresolved but I didn't know what. I just felt guilty and full of dread. From elementary school onward, I stayed anxious. I also frequently dissociated from the things and people around me; I often felt disconnected and depersonalized. Not just alone, but null and void.

In high school and college, I started feeling more and more of what I now recognize to be generalized anxiety and clinical depression -- a combination that often leads to suicidal ideation. But I didn't know what it was then. I just thought I had always been messed up.

At my lowest low, I saw a counselor through my college's mental health services. He wasn't too helpful -- he told me to carry seashells around in my pocket and to focus on them when I felt suicidal. Maybe a cute trick, but clearly not adequate treatment.

After college, I got a job doing healthcare research. I loved it -- the rigor, the problem solving, and the ability to pull meaning from numbers. I especially loved learning about common chronic health conditions -- diabetes, dementia, asthma -- that impacted people I knew. But I didn't know that I had one myself. Not a clue. 

I think people around me knew before I did. I remember a colleague telling me I looked depressed (y'all, don't say this to people in work meetings...) I didn't know I was depressed until, while doing research for a project on Alzheimer's, I read the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder and found myself unwittingly checking off the boxes. Basically ALL of them applied to me.

I got curious. I started googling. I found a TED talk by [Andrew Solomon](http://andrewsolomon.com/) called ['Depression, the secret we share.'](https://bit.ly/1lqfMRr) If you can, please watch this talk, y'all... even just part of it. It changed (honestly, saved) my life. I had no idea that my thoughts and feelings were the symptoms of a clinical health condition. This was so empowering and revelatory. I felt the relief of hearing the thoughts and feelings that had weighed me down throughout my whole life verbalized *by someone else* for the first time. I realized that suicidal thoughts are not 'normal' -- but that they are WAY more common than you'd think.

Depression, anxiety, and suicidality are extremely person-specific, so I am hesitant to generalize, BUT I will say that for many of us experiencing suicidal thoughts, these thoughts seem like Absolute Truths. Our brains trick us into thinking we're being objective. For me at least, this is why it's such a devastating blow when celebrities and people we idolize die by suicide... These deaths signal to my depression-addled mind that even life's most incredible highs -- like flying across the world to learn about wonderful cultures and people and food, creating your own fashion line, and inspiring millions of people -- can't make up for the lows. When I feel depressed, I fight so hard to reject that narrative. Sometimes it's easy. On days like today it's hard.

I listened to Andrew Solomon share his profound wisdom. I decided I was ready to ask for help. I found a therapist through my health plan. He was *complete* garbage. He said and asked all the wrong things. I left appointments feeling worse and couldn't leave my bed for days afterward. 

I gave up on therapists and tried to manage with the intuited, self-taught version of cognitive behavioral therapy that many of us have cobbled together on our own. At some point I confided in a few friends. I found that some had experienced depression too. I had NO idea that any of my beautiful, brilliant, ebullient friends were quietly suffering. It was simultaneously horrifying and comforting. One friend recommended their therapist, an LICSW who in turn had been recommended by another friend. But I didn't call her -- I was too skeptical and hurt by my damaging prior experiences with therapists. I spent the next year or so in limbo -- hiding depression by working too much, alternating between periods of 'high functioning' depression and complete debilitation. Eventually I realized I needed to give therapy another go.

I called the therapist my friend had recommended. She saw me immediately.

All I can say is that social workers are the absolute best. If you're a social worker: thank you for choosing that path. We appreciate you.

The woman my friend recommended has been my therapist for the past couple years and has helped me more than I can even say. I'll forever be more resilient and more capable of self-care because of this relationship, and also because of the psychiatrist she connected me with and the SSRI he prescribed. Starting it was like flipping a switch in my brain. After a few weeks of adjusting the dosage, I woke up one day expecting the usual anxiety and depression spirals -- but they didn't happen. It's not always easy. I have ups and downs, but I'm here and I'm okay. 

If you don't have a therapist but think you might benefit from having one, PLEASE start the search process. Finding a good one is not always as easy as getting a referral from a friend. It's sometimes very hard.

That's what I'm working on now -- I'm in grad school studying behavioral health policy. I want to make it possible for everyone to get the care I got.  It's sometimes triggering but I love it. I wouldn't be able to do it (or anything) without my therapist or meds.
