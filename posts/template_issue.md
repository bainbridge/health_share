[^1]: The resources I use to develop these issue breakdowns are saved in PDF form in my [Sources](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sILYzCXlqDw85Xy32z09_suQN8owSwi3) folder on Google Drive. I save PDFs in order to avoid the potential for dead links down the road. In the top right corner of page 1 of each PDF, you'll find the resource's URL. Please feel free to download or share these resources!
